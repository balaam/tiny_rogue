# Tiny Rogue - Graphics Edition

A version of Tiny Rogue using graphics.

Note: The source assets here cannot be shared publically. As they're a commercial asset. But you can share a build etc.

## Requirements

*UnityEditor:* Version 2019.2.x
I'm using 0b5 (e3a10156d6de).

(and it's using Unity Tiny 0.15.3-preview but this should get setup automatically for you via the Package Manager).

## Running the Project

If you open the project and press play you should get a player in a big room.
